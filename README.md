## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about 2,000 vehicles, including:

**Car ID**: Unique identifier for each car

**Brand**: Manufacturer of the car

**Model**: Specific car model

**Year**: Manufacturing year

**Color**: Car color

**Mileage**: Total miles driven

**Price**: Sale price of the car

**Location**: Geographic location of the car

## **Skills Demonstrated**

## **SQL**:

Data extraction and querying from a relational database

Aggregations, filtering, and grouping

Analyzing trends and patterns in structured data

## **Python**:

Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Statistical analysis and visualizations

Basic machine learning (e.g., linear regression with Scikit-learn)

Key Insights

SQL Analysis

Identified top brands by sales volume and average pricing.

Analyzed regional trends in vehicle distribution and pricing.

Python Analysis

Explored relationships between vehicle mileage, price, and manufacturing year.

Visualized brand distributions and regional preferences.

Built a linear regression model to predict vehicle prices (performance evaluation included).

Instructions to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Vehicle-Manufacturing-Analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Vehicle-Manufacturing-Analysis

Run the SQL code:

Use MySQL Workbench to execute sql/Vehicle-Manufacturing-Portfolio-Code.sql.

Execute the Python code:

Open python/Vehicle-Manufacturing-Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Ensure required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed.

Visualization Examples

Include key visualizations from your analysis here (e.g., histograms, bar charts, scatter plots).

Future Enhancements

Incorporate advanced machine learning models for price prediction.

Expand dataset with additional features like vehicle condition and owner history.
